# youtubedownloader

This simple script allows the user to download youtube videos. 

It takes in input the URL of the video and the PATH where it will be stored.

I decided to use `pytube` because "it is useless to reinvent the wheel".

If you want to use this script ensure that you have the `pytube` library.

Type `pip install pytube` and you shouldn't have problems.

Enjoy.
